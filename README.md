## **Features**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Dynamic Weather Rendering**: Fetches real-time weather data from APIs and updates the UI dynamically.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for weather updates by city.

### **Styling and Design**
- **Custom CSS Variables**: All colors, shadows, and styles are controlled using CSS variables for easy theme management.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Backdrops and Blur Effects**: Uses `backdrop-filter` for modern UI aesthetics.

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Custom Cursor**: A fixed-position cursor enhances the UX.
- **Progress Bar Animation**: A unique progress bar with smooth animation using CSS `@keyframes` to indicate loading states.
- **GSAP Animations**: Advanced animations for UI elements, making the app feel more dynamic and engaging.

### **Utility Features**
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages for invalid inputs or failed data fetching.
- **Utility Methods**: Includes modular and reusable JavaScript utility methods for fetching data and manipulating the DOM.

### **Advanced Implementation Details**
- **Text Shadows**: Subtle text-shadow effects are applied for a clean yet impactful typography experience.
- **Responsive Utility Classes**: Custom media queries ensure smooth scaling and responsiveness.
- **Accessibility Features**: Text sizes, color contrasts, and focus states are optimized for readability and usability.
- **Environmental Variables**: Securely manage API keys using `.env`.

## **Techniques and Tools**

### **Framework and Bundler**
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast bundling and hot module replacement (HMR).

### **Languages**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).

### **Design Principles**
- **SOLID Principles**: Code is modular and adheres to the Single Responsibility and Open-Closed principles, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Key parts of the app, like data fetching and rendering, are encapsulated into objects and classes.

### **CSS Techniques**
- Variables: `:root` color definitions.
  ```css
  :root {
    --color-white: #ffffff;
    --color-background: #0f0f0f;
    --color-midPink: #ad1d45;
    --color-sunOrange: #fd702d;
    --color-limeGreen: #2c6e49;
  }
  ```
- **Text Shadows**: Subtle yet impactful typography.
- **Backdrop Filter**: Blurred elements create depth in the UI.
- **Keyframe Animations**:
  ```css
  @keyframes progress {
    from {
      width: 100%;
    }
    to {
      width: 0;
    }
  }
  ```

### **Animations**
- **GSAP**: Smooth animations for enhanced interactivity.

### **Version Control and Deployment**
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Vite Deploy**: Ready-to-deploy build system.
- **GitHub Pages**: App hosted for easy access.

### **APIs and Libraries**
- **OpenWeather API**: Real-time weather data.
- **dotenv**: Secure environment variable management.
